ReactFunctComps,Redux,"*Using arrow functions when possible.<br/>
Write the code to create a simple reducer file, tha will have an ""initial_state"" object, containing the ""balance"" that will be 0.<br/>
The reducer function will have 2 parameters, state, but in case of not receiving any, it will have a default value corresponding to the initial_value object.<br/>
The second parameter is actions, and the reducer will behave differently in 3 situations:<br/>
-If action type is ""Deposit"", it will add the passed value to the balance and return it as a new object.<br/>
If ""Withdraw"", it will substract the value from balance and return it as a new object.<br/>
And as third option, if there is no argument passed, it will by default return the state.","const initial_state = {
	balance: 0
};

const reducer = (state = initial_state, action) =&gt; {
	switch(action.type){
		case ""Deposit"":
			return {balance: state.balance + action.payload};
		case ""Withdraw"":
			return {balance: state.balance - action.payload};
		default:
			return state;
	}
};
