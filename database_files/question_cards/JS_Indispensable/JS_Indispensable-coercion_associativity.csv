JS_Indispensable,Basics,"In a expression with 2 operators, like : ""3<2<1"", How does the engine processes it? Why it returns true?","It returns true because the operators are functions, so depending on the precedence and associativity, they compute the first operator function and <b>return</b> the value from it, then they perform the next calculation. And depending the value it expects, it could coerce the returned value, so it would be ""3<2<1"" goes to ""false<1"" then false gets coerced to 0, so it results in ""0<1"" which is true.",7,,,Has to do with the order,,,,,,,
