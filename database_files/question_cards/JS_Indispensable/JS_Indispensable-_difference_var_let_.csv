-Function scoped<br>
-It is hoisted, declarations are processed before any code is executed.<br>
-When initialized in a for loop, it is OUTSIDE the for loop because it is hoisted in the same lexical scope. It is accessible outside the for loop of course.<br>
-It creates a property in the global object if it is declared in the global lexical scope.<br>
<br>
<code>let:</code><br>
-Block scoped<br>
-It does not hoist.<br>
-It is not initialized until its definition is evaluated.<br>
-Accessing the variable before the initialization results in a ReferenceError.<br>
-In a for loop, it is INSIDE the for loop, unaccessible from outside. Every time the loop runs, the used let variable is destroyed and a new one is created.<br>
-It does not create properties on the global object when it is created.<br>
-It can be initialized just once.","var :
