<pre>var Person = function(name, age){
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
var john = new Person('John Doe', 40);</pre>","Because with the Function Constructor, in this case when we create an object we are using the ""new"" operator to indicate that ""this."" now points to our new empty object we are creating.",2,,,Wrong answer,,https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/5869182?start=275,04:35,,,,
